# Multiple-regression


In this we predict the carbon dioxide emissions from the cars

1. At first import the necessary modules for the data analysis.

2. load the dataset and check the few columns, check the data frame shape and size

3. Check for any null values present and duplicates as well

4. Drop the columns categorical columns that are not necessary for prediction.

5. Checking correlation between the numerical columns and target variable "CO2EMISSIONS".

6. Removing features which are highly correlated between them.

7. Standardizing the columns to remove the bias towards features with high values.

8. importing Multiple linear regression, Training and Testing the model.

9. Finding coefficients and intercept to predict y values

10. Checking through data visualization whether the multiple LR performs better than simple Linear Regression.

11. Checking mean_squared_error nd coefficient of deterimination score for respective models.
